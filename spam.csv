204,iphone version is very slow,Security Class

216,"then once i dl said book, if it's even on here, ibook is slow to respond and i'm repeatedly asked for my password simply to open the app",Security Class
217,sometimes it takes several days,Security Class
218,and the app is very sluggish when updating,Security Class
219,it downloads the books fast and are displayed nicely on your bookshelf,Security Class
220,"it loads painfully slowly on the ipad, for no discernible reason",Security Class
221,"it's not a bad platform, if you don't mind waiting, and waiting, for it to load",Security Class
222,"but the time i spend waiting for it to load the books i've already purchased, let alone trying to buy anything else makes me reluctant to put anyone else through the frustration i am put through every time i open the app",Security Class
223,"when i do get the chance to edit my books, i can do one change then it's back to the holding pattern of 3-5 mins",Security Class
224,the slowness of the ibookstore just drives me nuts,Security Class
225,not to mention the battery usage and heaven forbid if i switch from my ipad to my iphone and have to wait another 15+ minutes,Security Class
226,i say 15+ bc the last book took 40 freaking minutes w/ me having to constantly hit the cloud button to download over and over,Security Class

645,"my books won't even load now and for the first time ever, it appeared as if i had double-clicked the home button and i had screen slides, but i didn't and i could still search",Security Class
646,but it wouldn't even let me do anything else,Security Class
647,"used to be good, now it loses files during sync, and locks up when you attempt to save a",Security Class
648,"if you, in edit mode, reorder a file and rename it in the same session (without going to &#34in between), it confuses the file names, usually giving two different files the same name",Security Class
649,"books turn up missing, refuse to show up even after being downloaded, updates don't register, and when they do they don't disappear after downloading the update",Security Class
650,"gahh always freezing up, not completing downloads &amp",Security Class

669,i iwn a 4g ipod and when i'm opening my pdf files they don't open (they stay loading but never nothing happens) and is really frustrating,Security Class
670,i really love this the app but can't delete books i have read,Security Class
671,they remain on the bookshelf even after deleting,Security Class
672,this app usually works really well for me but for almost a week it has been refusing to let me download a book,Security Class
673,it asks me over and over to either type in my password or scan my finger but after a few tries it just quits,Security Class
674,i have been using ibooks gia a very long time but just found out i can not keep the pdf documents i downloaded when i redownload the app,Security Class

686,"i noticed when i googled it that there should be the option to change the tex size where it says  aa , but it's not there",Security Class
687,now it never stays in sync,Security Class
688,"i tried to reread one of my purchased books and when i went to me library, it said some of my books were downloading",Security Class

697,it has been crashing on me lately though,Security Class
698,"not all the time, but now and again it just turns off",Security Class
699,"now, deleting files is a major pain in the butt",Security Class
700,"even if you have fast internet , it takes a while for it to download a book , and a huge problem i had , is that i can't download the books i bought before",Security Class
701,i preordered a book and it's here now and it doesn't even download,Security Class
702,"loved the app before, but there is a bug when you try to change font size",Security Class

716,"i don't like to keep my ebooks as i download frequently and need to always delete them when i finish reading them, but i can't delete them since the button for 'edit' always seems to be loading",Security Class
717,and it just keeps showing up as loading no matter whether i've restarted my ipod or quit the app,Security Class
718,"i'm not too crazy about this version, because even though i can delete books i don't want anymore or just don't want stored on the program, it seems as thought you can't permanently delete them from ibooks anymore",Security Class
719,they fixed the app crashing issue when i try to buy books,Security Class
720,"additionally, whenever i start the app, it goes into a holding mode and i can't delete or move books for a good 5 minutes",Security Class
721,the words are bigger and every time i try to make them smaller it shuts down,Security Class
722,then when i try to get back on the words don't show up,Security Class

731,"it shows no progress in downloading but i can't read my book either, and i can't delete this to stop the issue",Security Class
732,problem was when it synced the collection to my iphone: three of the four didn't show up,Security Class
733,"looked at the purchased books, and the three lost don't show there either",Security Class
734,"so, even though you've paid for them, you can't have them",Security Class
735,and it seems they delete them for you,Security Class
736,"i purchased a book that was pretty big in size (almost 1 gb) and even though i had more than the recommended space available, it would never download",Security Class
737,"i was told to try again, so i did with no success",Security Class
738,this ap won't open books that i purchased,Security Class
739,"after 7 emails to support and uninstalling, upgrading, syncing and getting very upset, i still can't read my books",Security Class
740,my entire library is gone,Security Class

742,"i tried to restore and after 2 unsuccessful restores, i had to use a six month old backup, consequently losing all my contacts",Security Class
743,i bought a book and it wouldn't let me read it,Security Class
744,"when i read across devices and bookmark my pages, syncing doesn't occur like it used to",Security Class
745,the app closes itself about 5 seconds after opening every single time,Security Class
746,i especially don't enjoy getting halfway through a book only to discover i have to restart my device because the pages have gone blank,Security Class
747,i had some audio books that have just plain gone missing and they want me to buy them again,Security Class
748,"whenever i use ibooks on my ipad 2, while reading the screen dims, lights back up again (without me touching it), then dims again and then sleeps",Security Class
749,"i have auto lock set at 2 minutes, but with this problem it takes 4",Security Class
750,"the problem only occurs in this app, not on the homepage or other apps",Security Class
751,the app still crashes a lot and sometimes it takes a longtime for a book to download and/or open,Security Class
752,it doesn't show the books i already purchased,Security Class
753,so i often end of repurchasing the book,Security Class
754,it's also so slow and always crashing,Security Class
755,"so i checked my account, and it said i had $9 left, even though it said i had $22 before",Security Class
756,i went back i the app and it wasn't even in my library,Security Class
757,"it involves patiently waiting for items to be fully highlighted, 15 second intervals between page flips, annotations just sporadically running away from exstence, and even a few app crashes",Security Class
758,"for the second time in a year, after plugging my iphone in to backup using itunes, over half the pdf files i had on my phone are just gone",Security Class
759,"not losing any files for any other app, so i can't see how this is itunes doing it",Security Class
760,when i try to switch devices i'm lost,Security Class
761,actually it's kinda embarrasing about how an 'i' product cannot connect with airdrop,Security Class
762,"i can connect airdrop with my documents (yes, it's an app), but ibooks can't",Security Class
763,the app is buggy,Security Class
764,my notes and highlights got out of sync with their respective places in the book,Security Class
765,when i clicked on the notes/highlights i was redirected to an incorrect page,Security Class
766,i've been using the kindle app ever since i ran into the bug,Security Class
767,"well, every page of every one of my books has just gone black",Security Class
768,my pages still take forever to load while reading a book and don't get me started on downloading new books,Security Class
769,the app itself was always glitchy,Security Class
770,i just purchased a book and 4 hours later it still hasn't loaded,Security Class
771,it randomly shuts down while trying to download,Security Class
772,it has a few bugs but still works great,Security Class
773,it won't let me buy a book and it is frozen on its download and won't even let me download it again,Security Class
774,"however, i can't read when ibooks is continually glitching and shutting down for no reason",Security Class
775,"for some reason, no matter how many updates, ibooks always fails to work properly",Security Class
776,i love to read but the joy is being taken out of it when i'm always frustrated trying to get it to work,Security Class
777,"i love ibooks, but for the first time, ibooks stole my money",Security Class
778,so i spent $399 on nothing,Security Class
779,"listen up bubs, you'd best [exletive] interface this [exletive] app like the [exletive] app store because i will rage if this thing doesn't load properly",Security Class
780,takes ages to search any book,Security Class
781,many small bugs in it,Security Class
782,"it takes forever to load and once it does, the page doesn't scroll when you want it to",Security Class
783,not to mention it always crashing while i'm reading,Security Class
784,"disappointing and frustrating, i've tried troubleshooting and it just doesn't work",Security Class
785,my only complaint is the dictionary never works,Security Class
786,"bought with money 7 books, not one downloaded for three days",Security Class
787,the app crashes any time i click a title in the store,Security Class
788,"what is the point of having the app if you can't download things to read, or even preview anything",Security Class
789,i can't read the first sentence on the pages,Security Class
790,i use this app all the time and now it wont even open,Security Class

792,double loads books,Security Class
793,refuses to deletesome books,Security Class
794,"i kept about 3gb of reference books on me, but ibooks keeps deleting them along with all my categories",Security Class
795,then after three or four tries downloading the book it can't be found in the app,Security Class
796,i have to open and close the app numerous times to find the book on my ipad,Security Class
797,then when i finally find the book it freezes constantly and then flips through numerous pages,Security Class
798,also no matter how many pages you read the first time you close the book it goes back to page one,Security Class
799,cannot open up app at all,Security Class
800,terrible cheap scan quality lo-res bitmap charts and illustrations,Security Class
801,"all my highlights are clipped to two lines, so i can’t review anything",Security Class
802,"now, it takes forever to completely load",Security Class
803,books sometimes freeze when loading and while reading,Security Class
804,"tap on them in purchased books, they show as loading, but they never load",Security Class
805,"i have to load them onto another device, then delete them from all devices to attempt to load them onto my ipad for a second time",Security Class
806,really upset cause now i can't read anything i've paid for needs to fixed asap,Security Class
807,bookmarks no longer work,Security Class
808,skips two sizes when pressed once,Security Class
809,the app closes itself about 5 seconds after opening every single time,Security Class
810,lost or erased all my pdf files,Security Class
811,"doesn't work, at all",Security Class
812,books aren't downloading and formatting is way off,Security Class
813,why when i open my library to read does it prompt me to log in to itunes store,Security Class
814,where is my document,Security Class
815,i cannot redownload dictionaries,Security Class
816,it keeps freezing while i read,Security Class
817,currently impossible to view my purchased items,Security Class

819,lost all my epub library,Security Class
820,the store doesn't work,Security Class
821,the app is only showing me my library it will not let me go shop at the store  i'm highly upset,Security Class
822,it doesn't download,Security Class
823,its broken,Security Class
824,it's broke,Security Class
825,it crashes,Security Class
826,huge mistake here,Security Class
827,buggy and maddening,Security Class
828,big mistake,Security Class
829,don't download,Security Class
830,nothing works,Security Class
831,crashes,Security Class
832,double downloads,Security Class
833,it doesn't download,Security Class
834,don't download,Security Class
835,"it makes my phone run slower and it freezes and shuts off while i'm reading a book, and won't let me on other books",Security Class
836,i don't agree with it shutting down or crashing it works fine the only problem is if you don't have wifi and u go to the store it freezes it on that screen but it does go away ;),Security Class
837,there are several functions screwed up,Security Class
838,"sometimes store not connected or server not available, get this,often",Security Class
839,it is bugging out on key features that make it useless,Security Class
840,it keeps downloading multiple copies of my books,Security Class
841,"frequently crashes, ",Security Class
842,books don't download when i buy,Security Class
843,i used to look ibooks,Security Class
844,"utterly terrible actually, crashes all the time, ",Security Class
845,hangs often,Security Class
846,it is just make whatsapp interface ugly,Security Class
847,we can have together group chat in whats app it is also exraa odinary,Security Class
848,while talk on video u can not to other work,Security Class
849,while video chat u can not open other app if u open then video chat will be paused,Security Class
850,chating during night cause a lot of eye irritation,Security Class
851,"overall pretty good, however i dont like the fact that i have to save media files on to my phone to view them or use web whatsapp",Security Class
852,but if u guys would add football team logos or players emojis for football lovers than it'll be simply amazing,Security Class
853,most ugliest interface ever with most ugliest emoticons ever,Security Class
854,but it's not perfectly works like video call that's y l will give only,Security Class
855,while we are in offline also its ringing and in we are in other normal call also whats app call is coming not able to answer both the calls,Security Class
856,didn't liked the changed look of emojis,Security Class
857,it's all great execpt that we kinda get bored with the green colour,Security Class
858,change the ui like instagram or make it customizable,Security Class
859,i really dont like when we sent music files and it pops up a message and says some files have exeed  mb so could not be sent,Security Class
860,and other than that the video call clarity is not that good like other app so even this issue should be taken care of and other than that this app is exellent for chatting,Security Class
861,even what's made forward option more easier to use it,Security Class
862,"whatever we send,it will be compressed nd sent to the other person",Security Class
863,just wanted the feature of sending high resolution images too,Security Class
864,whatsapp has the feature to see who has viewed your message but heres the problem; we have to first highlight it then tap at the top of the screen and then in another window it shows who has viewed your message,Security Class
865,my whatsapp is working fine on my lg g  but the volume of the mic is very low in this application in specific,Security Class
866,i need tap on whatsapp apps to get the notification,Security Class
867,so for these changes i have to scroll down to bottom and select the default status,Security Class
868,i know you can send gifs but they convert to videos and giphy isn't built in like it is with texra and many other apps,Security Class
869,now i give a five star for adding what i've always wanted with style,Security Class
870,i would give it   stars if u could be able to let us have a bigger profile pic and make the noise a little more clearer in the calls other wise pretty great so please make a update thank u,Security Class
871,hope this apps will come our with animation emojis like line apps so it will be much more cool and awsome,Security Class
872,can the family emojis be improved to include people of colour,Security Class
873,"the latest update means that we have to hold down the record button to record a video, whereas before we just had to press it",Security Class
874,"sign language uses both hands, using one hand to hold the button down makes signing very difficult to produce and to understand",Security Class
875,the voice quality is horrific,Security Class
876,it'll be crazy fun to see animated and much more exressive emojis like shrug,Security Class
877,"for instance if i want to change my profile pic with hd pic or any other pic, it decreases the picture quality after updating your dp",Security Class
878,don't like the size of emojis,Security Class
879,is very poor cant open foto and videos when u dont have data but uve got monthly watsapp data is better the old vision does even show the colour if the msg is been read or wht i hate this  ,Security Class
880,old smileys were better than this,Security Class
881,we want old smileys back,Security Class
882,new smileys are too bad,Security Class
883,but its not clearly show video calling,Security Class
884,also please can u let people change the colour of whatsapp to a different one (e.g. right now it's green so can u please change it),Security Class
885,the emojis are disgusting and the old ones were so cute,Security Class
886,can you make some other emojis like the troll face or meme or something like those,Security Class
887,there's defect in apearance of online friends,Security Class
888,online friends should have special appearance in an dependant list,Security Class
889,now a days groups have thousands of messages so when you are seeing that messages and someone join or left the group it goes directly down to that notification that someone left the group or joined,Security Class
890,so you have to scroll thousands of messages to get back where you were,Security Class
891,and also so that i don't have to hold the record button for long when creating a voice note,Security Class
892,childish stickers and so on,Security Class
893,i am truly outraged that there is no potato emoji on whatsapp,Security Class
894,why have a pile of smiling crap when theres no potato,Security Class
895,there needs to be a potato emoji soon or else,Security Class
896,bring back the old status view below the dp,Security Class
897,the new emojis and the fact that they become bigger if used alone is an eye sore,Security Class
898,during calls also voice is not clear,Security Class
899,however the new emoji update is really bringing it down,Security Class
900,edit: and why are the emojis bigger what does it add u morons,Security Class
901,when we delete all chats from setting then broadcast list also get deleted and we need to creat again and again the new broadcast list,Security Class
902,this is exremely irritating as when trying to reply to someone i end up replying to someone else,Security Class
903,why does everything has to be on a white screen,Security Class
904,"sir, while we sent a photo of mb(megabyte) to other user then the photo size will automatically reduced/decrease to almost kb, after download the photo we will not be get the original size of photo for a result the image quality will converted into low quality",Security Class
905,why is sending gifs such a long-winded and confusing operation,Security Class
906,i'm not seeing the person i'm chatting with clearly as i would on other apps,Security Class
907,too much noice disturbance,Security Class
908,video is not clear of other person on call,Security Class
909,hat's off to the development team for upgrading the camera features (for non front camera flash mobile this app is a must ),Security Class
910,microphone recognition it's very low when i record audio messages,Security Class
911,good voice clarity nd video is in hd,Security Class
912,"its very easy to send massege to anyone with images , audio with vedio",Security Class
913,but the images are compressed way too much,Security Class
914,and strengthening the signals for calls,Security Class
915,the emojis look weird and different,Security Class
916,"they work on updates for basic stuff but the huge update that whatsapp could have, they don't even think of it and is the feature to change the color of the bubble messages and color themes",Security Class
917,this green and white is so boring at this era,Security Class
918,whenever m busy doing something important the whatsaap gives a pop up with the message arrived but it takes me out of the other things which are more important than whatsaap messages,Security Class
919,make it easier to remove yourself from groups,Security Class
920,simple ui with tons of features,Security Class
921,please put the status back to its prior place under one's dp before shared media,Security Class
922,have to scroll down to see another person's status,Security Class
923,when i upload my  -  mb full hdr picture as dp， after put on dp it was just remain    kb and having very bad quality,Security Class
924,like its the easiest app to use and its very clear and super fast to learn about,Security Class
925,"you have to close the app down, then go back on to it, call qualities are bad most of the time and etc",Security Class
926,most ugliest interface ever with most ugliest emoticons ever,Security Class
927,because children used and seen bad think and send bad video;photo,Security Class
928,whatsapp calling doesn't have material design,Security Class
929,app design should be changed,Security Class
930,more emoticons like in line or telegram would be great,Security Class

953,give an option to edit photos while sending from gallery and need more emojis this app has jsut basic emojis when compared to hangouts thought its implementation was fail but whats app need to make things available,Security Class
954,i can't stand that i have to go to ibooks to download files online  if i leave while it's downloading it won't work,Security Class
955,apple let people who prefer the look and feel of reading a book have the classic look back,Security Class
956,"the current look is ugly, cold, sterile, but most of all just not fun to read",Security Class
957,"return the old, not ordinary book design, please",Security Class
958,the design we have now is too plain,Security Class
959,"i mean its a book app, so it must look like book",Security Class
960,"the app is lame, with it's generic look",Security Class
961,i have to flip through chapters to start the book,Security Class
962,"i listening during my commute, so when i have to manually forward to the nex chapter, it becomes more trouble than it's worth",Security Class
963,love this new design,Security Class
964,i just wanted the spock's vulcan salute emoji icon and,Security Class
965,hate the new look,Security Class
966,bring back the bookshelf,Security Class
967,"the bookshelf felt cozy, as though you were actually pulling a book off the shelf",Security Class
968,terrible design after last update,Security Class
969,note to designers: dark room,Security Class
970,going back to the library is very jarring with its bright white background,Security Class
971,update and now this beautiful new design (boring,Security Class
972,"another thing, if you could add the arabic books to your library that would be good",Security Class
973,"even if there is another version released called ibooks classic with the wooden bookshelf ui , we will be thankful",Security Class
974,it's completely white and sterile and not the cozy wooden bookshelf it used to be,Security Class
975,i have loved the look of the original design with the wood and have avoided updated for the new design for over a year because of its cold look and lack of realism,Security Class
976,i am actually crying over the look,Security Class
977,the wood shelves were classy,Security Class
978,on the nex upgrade can you include a variety of bookshelf colors,Security Class
979,the pale gray is unattractive and hard on my eyes,Security Class
980,any wood stain color would suffice,Security Class
981,a bookshelf like that in real life and a whole room/personal library like that look has been my dream of the life,Security Class
982,the new updated look is a total crap,Security Class
983,please provide those old look at least as themes guys,Security Class
984,i miss the nice bookshelves of the old design – the white bars with gradients don't match up in terms of quality,Security Class
985,"even if you're not a fan of skeuomorphism, there's got to be something better than this flat design with gradients",Security Class
986,bring back the previous version's aesthetics along with new functionality,Security Class
987,new functionality doesn't mean you have to sacrifice aesthetics or visual design,Security Class
988,"this is the best app for reading books, but adding more fonts would make it even better",Security Class
989,"also, can you please bring the old design back",Security Class
990,my eyes hurt from the white bookshelf,Security Class
991,can't believe they ditched the wooden shelf,Security Class
992,trying to read a book and the book stuff is act weird,Security Class
993,"opening the app, i see that the recent releases section is now gone, replaced with popular sci-fi or fantasy",Security Class
994,"i personally think the back is okay, if a little dull",Security Class
995,"normally i don't write reviews, but the new ibooks  is so ugly",Security Class
996,"too white, too boring",Security Class
997,saw all that gorgeous and good looking share sheets and airdrop,Security Class
998,"i like the new icon, but the app itself is so white and boring",Security Class
999,you should at least make it orange as the icon,Security Class
1000,"the old look was a stranger in ios7, but still better looking and way more awesome",Security Class
1001,"i agree with many other reviewers -- the loss of the bookshelf look, the boring and ugly flat design plus the stark white background and inability to scale the type make it exremely difficult to read anything on this app",Security Class
1002,"ugly, i was looking forward to something new and sleek",Security Class
1003,hate the stark white boring look of the library,Security Class
1004,the kindle is a great app with an amazing book shelf and collection,Security Class
1005,ios7 y u no have color,Security Class
1006,"while i am all for a slick new look, the visual 'upgrades' to the new version seem like a regression",Security Class
1007,"to start, the library went from an aesthetically pleasing and functional bookshelf look to something that is now a bland and stark list view",Security Class
1008,i hate the new look,Security Class
1009,"need to put the old classic design back, it made you feel like you were reading a real book",Security Class
1010,the highlighter now looks horrible it looked real and better before the update,Security Class
1011,the awesome real shelf design is gone and all of these features need to come back or i will stop using this app,Security Class
1012,miss the bookshelf,Security Class
1013,even the highlighter is disappointing now; before it looked handwritten and now the perfect edges take away from that,Security Class
1014,down like the darker highlighter colors either,Security Class
1015,1- no more bookshelf look now it's stark white and boring,Security Class
1016,i don't like the color orange it's ugly,Security Class
1017,"this inside is great love that the bookshelf look is gone, but change the app color",Security Class
1018,who is the idiot responsible for ios 7's  art work,Security Class
1019,"did steve jobs say,  after i die, make ios as butt-phuck ugly as possible",Security Class
1020,"now they look exctly the same, and opening the file i want is a crapshoot",Security Class
1021,"this is not as important to me, but i also miss the nostalgic bookshelf look",Security Class
1022,why you gd to change the book shelf look,Security Class
1023,i give the new look 0 stars,Security Class
1024,"where's the wood, the color, the search",Security Class
1025,just spent an hour studying and highlighting an article for a presentation and one accidental tap at the end highlighted the whole article,Security Class
1026,now i had to delete the entire highlight note and i am back to zero,Security Class
1027,"the design is bad, too",Security Class
1028,"i loved how the book used to look like a book, and the shelf a shelf",Security Class
1029,"at the very least, the  old  aesthetic should be a skin option for the large number of us who prefer it",Security Class
1030,the bookshelf and look of pages had a nice feel to it and made reading more enjoyable,Security Class
1031,then they went and got rid of that design and replaced it with white,Security Class
1032,the bookshelf made it easier to find the books because it was a much easier platform to view,Security Class
1033,"i mean, we can still find books with the ios7 look, but it is more frustrating without the bookshelf",Security Class
1034,"if we can all get over the aesthetically annoying new layout, then i guess it's great",Security Class
1035,please change the layout back,Security Class
1036,any originality has been destroyed by bland ugly ios 7,Security Class
1037,"loss of the bookshelf is lame, now it's like any other competitors style",Security Class
1038,really likes the shelf look,Security Class
1039,i want my bookshelf back,Security Class
1040,"like so many reviews, the background is boring",Security Class
1041,i do love the app icon though,Security Class
1042,don't like the white backgroung,Security Class
1043,please return the bookshelf,Security Class
1044,or at least make the pages look like a book like the prior version of the ibooks application,Security Class
1045,this version is not beautiful as promised in the upgrade description,Security Class
1046,this new version of ibooks looks and feels like you're reading words on a whiteboard and not reading from a book,Security Class
1047,the fonts are limited and the overall look and actual navigation through the application is awful,Security Class
1048,but the new look is not very attractive to me i loved the bookshelf look,Security Class
1049,love the new modern look,Security Class
1050,"finally,vibrant colors and underline is noticeable",Security Class
1051,the gorgeous apple esthetic that seduced me away from my kindle has been replaced by one that gives me an eye ache,Security Class
1052,"and if they don't do something about how monstrously ugly ios 7 is, no way will my next tablet be an ipad",Security Class
1053,who ever thought that it would devolve into to something with such appalling color schemes and complete lack of eye appeal,Security Class
1054,not the new design,Security Class
1055,"i read my books there every time, i loved the book shelves they were oh so neat and clean",Security Class
1056,could care less how it looks,Security Class
1057,"if the head of product for ibooks actually used ibooks for reading, he or she would quickly see that having the screen auto-rotate by surprise completely ruins the reading exerience -- particularly when reading in bed",Security Class
1058,"sure, you can do this at the os level in ios7, but that means that you have to configure this setting every time you want to read a book and reconfigure it again every time you close ibooks",Security Class
1059,"this is bad product design, entirely unworthy of a product from apple",Security Class
1060,so you replace a nice traditional looking bookcase with a antiseptic looking white background that burns the retinas to a crisp,Security Class
1061,"i hate this new design , its looks ugly",Security Class
1062,i love using this app for my reading but i do miss the old book shelf design,Security Class
1063,"but for me the design doesn't matter as much, just as long as i can read my books, i'm good",Security Class
1064,"this is too blinding and the book theme is gone from ipad, wasn't this theme in one of their commercials at one point",Security Class
1065,"now what, let's advertise how much we can hurt your eyes and make this look like a white typed up sheet of paper, how boring",Security Class
1066,please go back to the old format,Security Class
1067,why is the what's new and pre-order sections missing in the sci-fi/fantasy section,Security Class
1068,love the new streamlined clean look,Security Class
1069,the hit space for the library button is too small,Security Class
1070,all you did was literally add a white background and strip basic aesthetic appeal away,Security Class
1071,every app looks the same now thanks to this bullsh*t ios 7 design,Security Class
1072,i found reading more enjoyable with the border and binding showing,Security Class
1073,the redesign isn't bad enough to earn it only one star,Security Class
1074,i finally decided to stick with ibooks over kindle because of the continuous scrolling,Security Class
1075,"i was hoping the ios 7 release would make it better, but instead it got a cleaner look with no performance upgrade at all",Security Class
1076,"i actually like the new look, i just want it to work in real time on an iphone 4",Security Class
1077,also don't like the new look,Security Class
1078,i likes the bookshelf look,Security Class
1079,oh i hate the new look,Security Class
1080,"it looks nothing like a library, don't know why they say it dose",Security Class
1081, :( it just looks like a white page to me,Security Class
1082,i don't care what new features they have added since it's as ugly as it is now,Security Class
1083,just too blank for my taste,Security Class
1084,"the new ios design forced me to put on my glasses because i no longer could view it properly, and now this even more bright background",Security Class
1085,"also, the title of the book is too large at the top",Security Class
1086,the white is glaringly annoying and un-bookstore-like,Security Class
1087,i absolutely hate the white sterile look,Security Class
1088, that wooden shelf was ugly,Security Class
1089,absolutely hate the new ibooks look,Security Class
1090,i'm giving this a 5 star rating because i think it's ridiculous that it's getting low ratings for it's appearance,Security Class
1091,the new design is awful,Security Class
1092,just adding white rectangles does not make it beautiful,Security Class
1093,but now really ugly,Security Class
1094,then all the work i did has to be put in the trash,Security Class
1095,as other reviewers stated the look has been changed and is boring,Security Class
1096,would like to see different colors for highlighting,Security Class
1097,there are only 5 colors and four of them are too dark bright,Security Class
1098,"the layout is simply horrendous and i'd sincerely like the wooden bookcase design back, it's a classic",Security Class
1099,"it's not fair that you have a series of books that you love and have purchased in the past, yet you have to pay again just to read it in ibooks",Security Class
1100,"i liked the old design a bit better, but change is usually for the better",Security Class
1101,"the new look is ok, but the old look of a wooden bookshelf was so much nicer",Security Class
1102,i don't like the new look and have downgraded to version 3,Security Class
1103,and why does an e-book need one inch margins,Security Class
1104,make use of the screen space on the ipad please,Security Class
1105,"new version presents me with a blank white and grey page, none of my previous documents, which i put in there so i would have them are there",Security Class
1106,if they are hidden in there somewhere i cannot find them with the usual tapping and swiping gestures,Security Class
1107,i like that it still had the feel of a traditional bookshelf and of actual page turning and so forth,Security Class
1108,so anything that still has the cozy feel of a library and books surrounding us really does make a difference,Security Class
1109,i feel like apple has simply lost its creativity in rolling out the new designs for the latest ios update,Security Class
1110,humble yourselves and be willing to make a change to at least turn the ibooks app back to its old design,Security Class
1111,"for all those who are crying about the new design, please note that this is the flat style design principle introduced by microsoft which focuses more on content rather than on the chrome",Security Class
1112,you appreciate it more after using it for a while and take a look back at the old ui,Security Class
1113,i used to love ibooks because of the realistic design,Security Class
1114,the realism made me feel like i was reading an actual book,Security Class
1115,the previous design was so beautiful and just felt a lot better,Security Class
1116,the new design is just boring and terrible,Security Class
1117,i still miss the wooden bookshelf,Security Class
1118,can you make more underline styles,Security Class
1119,"just plain red isn't enough, can we have a few more colors, a double underline, a wavy one, and a strike through",Security Class
1120,a few more highlight colors would be nice too,Security Class
1121,some other language dictionaries would be fabulous,Security Class
1122,"you can't search properly, oh and thanks so much, i really need to sort by best sellers",Security Class
1123,i do this a lot because the dictionary is only available in like 4 languages,Security Class
1124,"if i do adopt ios 8 again, i still won't suffer this ugly ibooks",Security Class
1125,now it's white &amp lifeless,Security Class
1126,"the app used to be beautiful, the way the pages looked like pages, the shelf, all of it",Security Class
1127,i display my books in list and the font for the authors' names is so gray and small that it is unreadable,Security Class
1128,please change back to the more vibrant colors for highlighting,Security Class
1129,the colors are dull now,Security Class
1130,please put back on the right hand side of the page,Security Class
1131,"i may send a product catalog and a quote, but have to do 2 separate emails currently",Security Class
1132,all this white takes away from the user exerience,Security Class
1133,"the minimalist design could be nice, yet it just comes off cheap and hard to look at",Security Class
1134,however the most disheartening is the look,Security Class
1135,"i hate the that the wooden bookcase look is gone  which is the reason i was drawn to the app,  this look",Security Class
1136,"please put it back , it felt like i was in my own private library picking out a book to curl up and read",Security Class
1137,make the app so we can use moré colors to highlite and to change the background of the things,Security Class
1138,i absolutely loved the bookshelf design and how it made your books look like actual books when you were reading them,Security Class
1139,i don't know if you're trying to look cool with this new design or what but we hate this new look and we all loved the bookshelf look,Security Class
1140,please bring back the old design or i will delete this app and find a new book program,Security Class
1141,"if there was a rating lower than 1 star i would've given this app that rating, but had you kept that old design i would've given you a full 5 stars",Security Class
1142,he types in his password and then it asks for security questions,Security Class
1143,i can not download books because my grandfather doesnt remember his  favorite teacher  and his  least favorite teacher  he claims he never even answered those questions,Security Class
1144,please remove the huge side margins,Security Class
1145,"i love ibooks but, since apple got rid of the pastel colors for highlighting i can only use maybe two of the colors and still have it be legible",Security Class
1146,they are too small to read unless opened,Security Class
1147,"can't find a book unless i know exctly what book i'm looking for, usually by going to look it up on amazon or google",Security Class
1148,i would like a couple of new colors for highlighting,Security Class
1149,"really annoying because when i reopen, i need to figure out where i was last reading",Security Class
1150,please make the pageview bigger by getting rid of border space,Security Class
1151,my ipad has already wide bezels,Security Class
1152,"i got this app, and the tex is way too small",Security Class
1153,"it's so hard to read, and when i zoom in i have to constantly scroll back and forth, which hurts my eyes",Security Class
1154,please go back to skeuomorphic look,Security Class
1155,but anyway its not perfect you could improve a few things such as 1) get some back ground on this i mean it doesn't have to be so plain and boring,Security Class
1156,"i finally had to cave and update to this crappy white boring os version, and you've completely ruined my fave app",Security Class
1157,"it's a book app, why would u take the bookshelf off, the pages, the feel of a book  plain white",Security Class
1158,since when is glaring white a design improvement,Security Class
1159,bring back the old bookshelf and the page look,Security Class
1160,and there needs to be more highlight colors,Security Class
1161,i literally have to look through all of the books i have downloaded to get to the ones i haven't read,Security Class
1162,"mention one thing, hate the highlighting colors now provided",Security Class
1163,all are too dark,Security Class
1164,"listen, apple: what is it with the whiteness and brightness of everything",Security Class
1165,"also, i liked the faux bookshelves",Security Class
1166,"gives you a lot more control when reading books, specially for someone with such bad eye sight as myself",Security Class
1167,as it is i keep having to arrange manually all the series with multiple books,Security Class
1168,"now it's just a plain, blasé bore to look at",Security Class
1169,this app probably looks better the first time you use it but it gets pretty ugly,Security Class
1170,who cares about a bookshelf background,Security Class
1171,"fortunately, i still hasn't updated my ibooks because i love its current design",Security Class
1172,"i've been thinking for about some time to finally update my ibooks because i really do update all of my apps but of course, i'll make sure first that the new look of my app is better",Security Class
1173,i really hate that i can only underline in red,Security Class
1174,i do not like the new layout,Security Class
1175,"like someone else posted on here, we should be able to revert back to the original background/layout",Security Class
1176,the margin is not adjustable which makes a huge waste of the iphone’s screen,Security Class
1177,"the ui is terrible, ugly, and unbearable",Security Class
1178,"besides, ibooks supports very few dictionary",Security Class
1179,"it’s sad because you cannot exect to use it as a tool for learning a second language, say, french or german, while my kindle paperwhite can do everything i want it to do exept it is a little bit slow",Security Class
1180,"on my iphone when i enlarge my font, the paragraph spaces also get enlarged plus the tittle sizes and it just looks the words have vomited on the page",Security Class
1181,"and, while you're at it, change the color to sepia, change the font and its size, and adjust the brightness",Security Class
1182,"the wood-look bookshelves are gone, but that doesn't affect the reading",Security Class
1183,"if you search the word 'the', it also comes up with 'there' and 'together' and more",Security Class
1184,it would be better with the old design or any design that resembles a book shelf,Security Class
1185,"please change the white color and the icon, i never liked this update",Security Class
1186,i miss the bookshelf background,Security Class
1187,"i have to have wifi access to download my entire collection every time, and no access to my pdfs",Security Class
1188,this is the one app that should feel less like a white-washed wall and more like real-life,Security Class
1189,the blaring white interface makes it virtually impossible to use this app without feeling as though you've been staring directly at the sun,Security Class
1190,"just like ios 7, functionality and customer satisfaction were not even considered in the design",Security Class
1191,"i've switched to a different reader, one developed with the customer in mind and one that i can actually use without burning my retinas",Security Class
1192,could you please tone down the intensity of the highlighting color feature in ibooks,Security Class
1193,i had an ipad 1st generation and it's ibooks had highlighting colors that were more pastel,Security Class
1194,much easier on the eyes than the current version,Security Class
1195,"ps the new gui still looks stupid, too",Security Class
1196,can apple make their devices more boring and ugly,Security Class
1197,ios7 is design cancer spreading to all the apps,Security Class
1198,"for my remaining ibooks purchases, i have switched back to my 2010 old ipad with it's ibooks app as all the reworks of apps to ios7 are so ugly, lower ui",Security Class
1199,why would i buy a new ios8 ipad with apple's insistence on ugly,Security Class
1200,the look and feel of having a library and bookshelves has been f****** ripped away,Security Class
1201,"sure, like lots of the other reviews, i would like to see different themes available so it feels like reading a real book in the app but for me that isn't the biggest problem",Security Class
1202,"i still have the ios 6 version of this app because i have had a preview of the new look of the ios 7 ibooks and honestly, it looks as if no effort was put into the design of the app whatsoever",Security Class
1203,i enjoy having the wood texure for my background,Security Class
1204,design is out of place and doesn't suit reading,Security Class
1205,i want the view back on the page where i can see how many pages are left in a chapter,Security Class
1206,i loved the ui with the virtual bookshelf,Security Class
1207,as for or myself i can say that i will be looking at other options if all i get from you for my money are apps that are ugly and become more and more dysfunctional,Security Class
1208,the background is nothing like a bookshelf,Security Class
1209,just a piece of white paper with book titles on it,Security Class
1210,i miss the look of the book case and why update,Security Class
1211,the wooden book shelf was the best part of the ibooks app,Security Class
1212,i really hate the white background,Security Class
1213,bring it back or at least the option to turn it on if you want,Security Class
1214,the books are too exensive and the library is small,Security Class
1215,i could care less about the design,Security Class
1216,i'm really tired of having to sign in every time i open the app,Security Class
1217,"also, i'd like to be able to decrease margins",Security Class
1218,as it is now it seem like there is tex only on roughly half the screen because the margins are so wide,Security Class
1219,i get tired of having to switch to safari to buy books on other apps,Security Class
1220,going from my dark desktop to my  night mode book should not involve being forced to look at a glaring white screen that hurts my eyes (even at the lowest brightness),Security Class
1221,i want the look of a real book with a virtual binder line between the two columns,Security Class
1222,too mainstream look,Security Class
1223,"need some changes in look (don't know how to put it in)
hope for some small changes soon",Security Class
1224,i like that you can change the page color and bookmark pages,Security Class
1225,"if you really don't like the new style, then remember this: you did't get the app just to look at its background",Security Class
1226,bad bad bad bad design,Security Class
1227,whoever designed this design  has to understand that people dont like boring white gradients with floating things on everything,Security Class
1228,it's like the page isn't calibrated,Security Class

2128,now i give a five star for adding what i've always wanted with style,Usability Class

2132,"the latest update means that we have to hold down the record button to record a video, whereas before we just had to press it",Usability Class
2133,"sign language uses both hands, using one hand to hold the button down makes signing very difficult to produce and to understand",Usability Class
2134,the voice quality is horrific,Usability Class
2135,it'll be crazy fun to see animated and much more exressive emojis like shrug,Usability Class
2136,"for instance if i want to change my profile pic with hd pic or any other pic, it decreases the picture quality after updating your dp",Usability Class
2137,don't like the size of emojis,Usability Class

2145,can you make some other emojis like the troll face or meme or something like those,Usability Class
2146,there's defect in apearance of online friends,Usability Class
2147,online friends should have special appearance in an dependant list,Usability Class
2148,now a days groups have thousands of messages so when you are seeing that messages and someone join or left the group it goes directly down to that notification that someone left the group or joined,Usability Class
2149,so you have to scroll thousands of messages to get back where you were,Usability Class
2150,and also so that i don't have to hold the record button for long when creating a voice note,Usability Class
2151,childish stickers and so on,Usability Class
2152,i am truly outraged that there is no potato emoji on whatsapp,Usability Class

2154,there needs to be a potato emoji soon or else,Usability Class
2155,bring back the old status view below the dp,Usability Class
2156,the new emojis and the fact that they become bigger if used alone is an eye sore,Usability Class
2157,during calls also voice is not clear,Usability Class
2158,however the new emoji update is really bringing it down,Usability Class
2159,edit: and why are the emojis bigger what does it add u morons,Usability Class
2160,when we delete all chats from setting then broadcast list also get deleted and we need to creat again and again the new broadcast list,Usability Class
2161,this is exremely irritating as when trying to reply to someone i end up replying to someone else,Usability Class
2162,why does everything has to be on a white screen,Usability Class
2163,"sir, while we sent a photo of mb(megabyte) to other user then the photo size will automatically reduced/decrease to almost kb, after download the photo we will not be get the original size of photo for a result the image quality will converted into low quality",Usability Class
2164,why is sending gifs such a long-winded and confusing operation,Usability Class
2165,i'm not seeing the person i'm chatting with clearly as i would on other apps,Usability Class
2166,too much noice disturbance,Usability Class
2167,video is not clear of other person on call,Usability Class

2170,good voice clarity nd video is in hd,Usability Class
2171,"its very easy to send massege to anyone with images , audio with vedio",Usability Class
2172,but the images are compressed way too much,Usability Class
2173,and strengthening the signals for calls,Usability Class
2174,the emojis look weird and different,Usability Class
2175,"they work on updates for basic stuff but the huge update that whatsapp could have, they don't even think of it and is the feature to change the color of the bubble messages and color themes",Usability Class
2176,this green and white is so boring at this era,Usability Class
2177,whenever m busy doing something important the whatsaap gives a pop up with the message arrived but it takes me out of the other things which are more important than whatsaap messages,Usability Class
2178,make it easier to remove yourself from groups,Usability Class
2179,simple ui with tons of features,Usability Class
2180,please put the status back to its prior place under one's dp before shared media,Usability Class
2181,have to scroll down to see another person's status,Usability Class
2182,when i upload my  -  mb full hdr picture as dp， after put on dp it was just remain    kb and having very bad quality,Usability Class
2183,like its the easiest app to use and its very clear and super fast to learn about,Usability Class
2184,"you have to close the app down, then go back on to it, call qualities are bad most of the time and etc",Usability Class
2185,most ugliest interface ever with most ugliest emoticons ever,Usability Class
2186,because children used and seen bad think and send bad video;photo,Usability Class
2187,whatsapp calling doesn't have material design,Usability Class

2209,the voice calls and video calles aren't so clear ,Usability Class

2211,when i went through the different emojis i saw middle finger then i was thinking why would the creator of whatsapp put a middle finger in the emojis like that's wrong who puts bad nonsense in an app,Usability Class

2213,i can't stand that i have to go to ibooks to download files online  if i leave while it's downloading it won't work,Usability Class
2214,apple let people who prefer the look and feel of reading a book have the classic look back,Usability Class
2215,"the current look is ugly, cold, sterile, but most of all just not fun to read",Usability Class
2216,"return the old, not ordinary book design, please",Usability Class
2217,the design we have now is too plain,Usability Class
2218,"i mean its a book app, so it must look like book",Usability Class
2219,"the app is lame, with it's generic look",Usability Class
2220,i have to flip through chapters to start the book,Usability Class
2221,"i listening during my commute, so when i have to manually forward to the nex chapter, it becomes more trouble than it's worth",Usability Class
2222,love this new design,Usability Class
2223,i just wanted the spock's vulcan salute emoji icon and,Usability Class
2224,hate the new look,Usability Class
2225,bring back the bookshelf,Usability Class
2226,"the bookshelf felt cozy, as though you were actually pulling a book off the shelf",Usability Class
2227,terrible design after last update,Usability Class
2228,note to designers: dark room,Usability Class
2229,going back to the library is very jarring with its bright white background,Usability Class
2230,update and now this beautiful new design (boring,Usability Class
2231,"another thing, if you could add the arabic books to your library that would be good",Usability Class
2232,"even if there is another version released called ibooks classic with the wooden bookshelf ui , we will be thankful",Usability Class
2233,it's completely white and sterile and not the cozy wooden bookshelf it used to be,Usability Class
2234,i have loved the look of the original design with the wood and have avoided updated for the new design for over a year because of its cold look and lack of realism,Usability Class
2235,i am actually crying over the look,Usability Class
2236,the wood shelves were classy,Usability Class
2237,on the nex upgrade can you include a variety of bookshelf colors,Usability Class
2238,the pale gray is unattractive and hard on my eyes,Usability Class
2239,any wood stain color would suffice,Usability Class
2240,a bookshelf like that in real life and a whole room/personal library like that look has been my dream of the life,Usability Class
2241,the new updated look is a total crap,Usability Class
2242,please provide those old look at least as themes guys,Usability Class
2243,i miss the nice bookshelves of the old design – the white bars with gradients don't match up in terms of quality,Usability Class
2244,"even if you're not a fan of skeuomorphism, there's got to be something better than this flat design with gradients",Usability Class
2245,bring back the previous version's aesthetics along with new functionality,Usability Class
2246,new functionality doesn't mean you have to sacrifice aesthetics or visual design,Usability Class
2247,"this is the best app for reading books, but adding more fonts would make it even better",Usability Class
2248,"also, can you please bring the old design back",Usability Class
2249,my eyes hurt from the white bookshelf,Usability Class
2250,can't believe they ditched the wooden shelf,Usability Class
2251,trying to read a book and the book stuff is act weird,Usability Class
2252,"opening the app, i see that the recent releases section is now gone, replaced with popular sci-fi or fantasy",Usability Class
2253,"i personally think the back is okay, if a little dull",Usability Class
2254,"normally i don't write reviews, but the new ibooks  is so ugly",Usability Class
2255,"too white, too boring",Usability Class
2256,saw all that gorgeous and good looking share sheets and airdrop,Usability Class
2257,"i like the new icon, but the app itself is so white and boring",Usability Class
2258,you should at least make it orange as the icon,Usability Class
2259,"the old look was a stranger in ios7, but still better looking and way more awesome",Usability Class
2260,"i agree with many other reviewers -- the loss of the bookshelf look, the boring and ugly flat design plus the stark white background and inability to scale the type make it exremely difficult to read anything on this app",Usability Class
2261,"ugly, i was looking forward to something new and sleek",Usability Class
2262,hate the stark white boring look of the library,Usability Class
2263,the kindle is a great app with an amazing book shelf and collection,Usability Class
2264,ios7 y u no have color,Usability Class
2265,"while i am all for a slick new look, the visual 'upgrades' to the new version seem like a regression",Usability Class
2266,"to start, the library went from an aesthetically pleasing and functional bookshelf look to something that is now a bland and stark list view",Usability Class
2267,i hate the new look,Usability Class
2268,"need to put the old classic design back, it made you feel like you were reading a real book",Usability Class
2269,the highlighter now looks horrible it looked real and better before the update,Usability Class
2270,the awesome real shelf design is gone and all of these features need to come back or i will stop using this app,Usability Class
2271,miss the bookshelf,Usability Class
2272,even the highlighter is disappointing now; before it looked handwritten and now the perfect edges take away from that,Usability Class
2273,down like the darker highlighter colors either,Usability Class
2274,1- no more bookshelf look now it's stark white and boring,Usability Class
2275,i don't like the color orange it's ugly,Usability Class
2276,"this inside is great love that the bookshelf look is gone, but change the app color",Usability Class
2277,who is the idiot responsible for ios 7's  art work,Usability Class
2278,"did steve jobs say,  after i die, make ios as butt-phuck ugly as possible",Usability Class
2279,"now they look exctly the same, and opening the file i want is a crapshoot",Usability Class
2280,"this is not as important to me, but i also miss the nostalgic bookshelf look",Usability Class
2281,why you gd to change the book shelf look,Usability Class
2282,i give the new look 0 stars,Usability Class
2283,"where's the wood, the color, the search",Usability Class
2284,just spent an hour studying and highlighting an article for a presentation and one accidental tap at the end highlighted the whole article,Usability Class
2285,now i had to delete the entire highlight note and i am back to zero,Usability Class
2286,"the design is bad, too",Usability Class
2287,"i loved how the book used to look like a book, and the shelf a shelf",Usability Class
2288,"at the very least, the  old  aesthetic should be a skin option for the large number of us who prefer it",Usability Class
2289,the bookshelf and look of pages had a nice feel to it and made reading more enjoyable,Usability Class
2290,then they went and got rid of that design and replaced it with white,Usability Class
2291,the bookshelf made it easier to find the books because it was a much easier platform to view,Usability Class
2292,"i mean, we can still find books with the ios7 look, but it is more frustrating without the bookshelf",Usability Class
2293,"if we can all get over the aesthetically annoying new layout, then i guess it's great",Usability Class
2294,please change the layout back,Usability Class
2295,any originality has been destroyed by bland ugly ios 7,Usability Class
2296,"loss of the bookshelf is lame, now it's like any other competitors style",Usability Class
2297,really likes the shelf look,Usability Class
2298,i want my bookshelf back,Usability Class
2299,"like so many reviews, the background is boring",Usability Class
2300,i do love the app icon though,Usability Class
2301,don't like the white backgroung,Usability Class
2302,please return the bookshelf,Usability Class
2303,or at least make the pages look like a book like the prior version of the ibooks application,Usability Class
2304,this version is not beautiful as promised in the upgrade description,Usability Class
2305,this new version of ibooks looks and feels like you're reading words on a whiteboard and not reading from a book,Usability Class
2306,the fonts are limited and the overall look and actual navigation through the application is awful,Usability Class
2307,but the new look is not very attractive to me i loved the bookshelf look,Usability Class
2308,love the new modern look,Usability Class
2309,"finally,vibrant colors and underline is noticeable",Usability Class
2310,the gorgeous apple esthetic that seduced me away from my kindle has been replaced by one that gives me an eye ache,Usability Class
2311,"and if they don't do something about how monstrously ugly ios 7 is, no way will my next tablet be an ipad",Usability Class
2312,who ever thought that it would devolve into to something with such appalling color schemes and complete lack of eye appeal,Usability Class
2313,not the new design,Usability Class
2314,"i read my books there every time, i loved the book shelves they were oh so neat and clean",Usability Class
2315,could care less how it looks,Usability Class
2316,"if the head of product for ibooks actually used ibooks for reading, he or she would quickly see that having the screen auto-rotate by surprise completely ruins the reading exerience -- particularly when reading in bed",Usability Class
2317,"sure, you can do this at the os level in ios7, but that means that you have to configure this setting every time you want to read a book and reconfigure it again every time you close ibooks",Usability Class
2318,"this is bad product design, entirely unworthy of a product from apple",Usability Class
2319,so you replace a nice traditional looking bookcase with a antiseptic looking white background that burns the retinas to a crisp,Usability Class
2320,"i hate this new design , its looks ugly",Usability Class
2321,i love using this app for my reading but i do miss the old book shelf design,Usability Class
2322,"but for me the design doesn't matter as much, just as long as i can read my books, i'm good",Usability Class
2323,"this is too blinding and the book theme is gone from ipad, wasn't this theme in one of their commercials at one point",Usability Class
2324,"now what, let's advertise how much we can hurt your eyes and make this look like a white typed up sheet of paper, how boring",Usability Class
2325,please go back to the old format,Usability Class
2326,why is the what's new and pre-order sections missing in the sci-fi/fantasy section,Usability Class
2327,love the new streamlined clean look,Usability Class
2328,the hit space for the library button is too small,Usability Class
2329,all you did was literally add a white background and strip basic aesthetic appeal away,Usability Class
2330,every app looks the same now thanks to this bullsh*t ios 7 design,Usability Class
2331,i found reading more enjoyable with the border and binding showing,Usability Class
2332,the redesign isn't bad enough to earn it only one star,Usability Class
2333,i finally decided to stick with ibooks over kindle because of the continuous scrolling,Usability Class
2334,"i was hoping the ios 7 release would make it better, but instead it got a cleaner look with no performance upgrade at all",Usability Class
2335,"i actually like the new look, i just want it to work in real time on an iphone 4",Usability Class
2336,also don't like the new look,Usability Class
2337,i likes the bookshelf look,Usability Class
2338,oh i hate the new look,Usability Class
2339,"it looks nothing like a library, don't know why they say it dose",Usability Class
2340, :( it just looks like a white page to me,Usability Class
2341,i don't care what new features they have added since it's as ugly as it is now,Usability Class
2342,just too blank for my taste,Usability Class
2343,"the new ios design forced me to put on my glasses because i no longer could view it properly, and now this even more bright background",Usability Class
2344,"also, the title of the book is too large at the top",Usability Class
2345,the white is glaringly annoying and un-bookstore-like,Usability Class
2346,i absolutely hate the white sterile look,Usability Class
2347, that wooden shelf was ugly,Usability Class
2348,absolutely hate the new ibooks look,Usability Class
2349,i'm giving this a 5 star rating because i think it's ridiculous that it's getting low ratings for it's appearance,Usability Class
2350,the new design is awful,Usability Class
2351,just adding white rectangles does not make it beautiful,Usability Class
2352,but now really ugly,Usability Class
2353,then all the work i did has to be put in the trash,Usability Class
2354,as other reviewers stated the look has been changed and is boring,Usability Class
2355,would like to see different colors for highlighting,Usability Class
2356,there are only 5 colors and four of them are too dark bright,Usability Class
2357,"the layout is simply horrendous and i'd sincerely like the wooden bookcase design back, it's a classic",Usability Class
2358,"it's not fair that you have a series of books that you love and have purchased in the past, yet you have to pay again just to read it in ibooks",Usability Class
2359,"i liked the old design a bit better, but change is usually for the better",Usability Class
2360,"the new look is ok, but the old look of a wooden bookshelf was so much nicer",Usability Class
2361,i don't like the new look and have downgraded to version 3,Usability Class
2362,and why does an e-book need one inch margins,Usability Class
2363,make use of the screen space on the ipad please,Usability Class
2364,"new version presents me with a blank white and grey page, none of my previous documents, which i put in there so i would have them are there",Usability Class
2365,if they are hidden in there somewhere i cannot find them with the usual tapping and swiping gestures,Usability Class
2366,i like that it still had the feel of a traditional bookshelf and of actual page turning and so forth,Usability Class
2367,so anything that still has the cozy feel of a library and books surrounding us really does make a difference,Usability Class
2368,i feel like apple has simply lost its creativity in rolling out the new designs for the latest ios update,Usability Class
2369,humble yourselves and be willing to make a change to at least turn the ibooks app back to its old design,Usability Class
2370,"for all those who are crying about the new design, please note that this is the flat style design principle introduced by microsoft which focuses more on content rather than on the chrome",Usability Class
2371,you appreciate it more after using it for a while and take a look back at the old ui,Usability Class
2372,i used to love ibooks because of the realistic design,Usability Class
2373,the realism made me feel like i was reading an actual book,Usability Class
2374,the previous design was so beautiful and just felt a lot better,Usability Class
2375,the new design is just boring and terrible,Usability Class
2376,i still miss the wooden bookshelf,Usability Class
2377,can you make more underline styles,Usability Class
2378,"just plain red isn't enough, can we have a few more colors, a double underline, a wavy one, and a strike through",Usability Class
2379,a few more highlight colors would be nice too,Usability Class
2380,some other language dictionaries would be fabulous,Usability Class
2381,"you can't search properly, oh and thanks so much, i really need to sort by best sellers",Usability Class
2382,i do this a lot because the dictionary is only available in like 4 languages,Usability Class
2383,"if i do adopt ios 8 again, i still won't suffer this ugly ibooks",Usability Class
2384,now it's white &amp lifeless,Usability Class
2385,"the app used to be beautiful, the way the pages looked like pages, the shelf, all of it",Usability Class
2386,i display my books in list and the font for the authors' names is so gray and small that it is unreadable,Usability Class
2387,please change back to the more vibrant colors for highlighting,Usability Class
2388,the colors are dull now,Usability Class
2389,please put back on the right hand side of the page,Usability Class
2390,"i may send a product catalog and a quote, but have to do 2 separate emails currently",Usability Class
2391,all this white takes away from the user exerience,Usability Class
2392,"the minimalist design could be nice, yet it just comes off cheap and hard to look at",Usability Class
2393,however the most disheartening is the look,Usability Class
2394,"i hate the that the wooden bookcase look is gone  which is the reason i was drawn to the app,  this look",Usability Class
2395,"please put it back , it felt like i was in my own private library picking out a book to curl up and read",Usability Class
2396,make the app so we can use moré colors to highlite and to change the background of the things,Usability Class
2397,i absolutely loved the bookshelf design and how it made your books look like actual books when you were reading them,Usability Class
2398,i don't know if you're trying to look cool with this new design or what but we hate this new look and we all loved the bookshelf look,Usability Class
2399,please bring back the old design or i will delete this app and find a new book program,Usability Class
2400,"if there was a rating lower than 1 star i would've given this app that rating, but had you kept that old design i would've given you a full 5 stars",Usability Class
2401,he types in his password and then it asks for security questions,Usability Class
2402,i can not download books because my grandfather doesnt remember his  favorite teacher  and his  least favorite teacher  he claims he never even answered those questions,Usability Class
2403,please remove the huge side margins,Usability Class
2404,"i love ibooks but, since apple got rid of the pastel colors for highlighting i can only use maybe two of the colors and still have it be legible",Usability Class
2405,they are too small to read unless opened,Usability Class
2406,"can't find a book unless i know exctly what book i'm looking for, usually by going to look it up on amazon or google",Usability Class
2407,i would like a couple of new colors for highlighting,Usability Class
2408,"really annoying because when i reopen, i need to figure out where i was last reading",Usability Class
2409,please make the pageview bigger by getting rid of border space,Usability Class
2410,my ipad has already wide bezels,Usability Class
2411,"i got this app, and the tex is way too small",Usability Class
2412,"it's so hard to read, and when i zoom in i have to constantly scroll back and forth, which hurts my eyes",Usability Class
2413,please go back to skeuomorphic look,Usability Class
2414,but anyway its not perfect you could improve a few things such as 1) get some back ground on this i mean it doesn't have to be so plain and boring,Usability Class
2415,"i finally had to cave and update to this crappy white boring os version, and you've completely ruined my fave app",Usability Class
2416,"it's a book app, why would u take the bookshelf off, the pages, the feel of a book  plain white",Usability Class
2417,since when is glaring white a design improvement,Usability Class
2418,bring back the old bookshelf and the page look,Usability Class
2419,and there needs to be more highlight colors,Usability Class
2420,i literally have to look through all of the books i have downloaded to get to the ones i haven't read,Usability Class
2421,"mention one thing, hate the highlighting colors now provided",Usability Class
2422,all are too dark,Usability Class
2423,"listen, apple: what is it with the whiteness and brightness of everything",Usability Class
2424,"also, i liked the faux bookshelves",Usability Class
2425,"gives you a lot more control when reading books, specially for someone with such bad eye sight as myself",Usability Class
2426,as it is i keep having to arrange manually all the series with multiple books,Usability Class
2427,"now it's just a plain, blasé bore to look at",Usability Class
2428,this app probably looks better the first time you use it but it gets pretty ugly,Usability Class
2429,who cares about a bookshelf background,Usability Class
2430,"fortunately, i still hasn't updated my ibooks because i love its current design",Usability Class
2431,"i've been thinking for about some time to finally update my ibooks because i really do update all of my apps but of course, i'll make sure first that the new look of my app is better",Usability Class
2432,i really hate that i can only underline in red,Usability Class
2433,i do not like the new layout,Usability Class
2434,"like someone else posted on here, we should be able to revert back to the original background/layout",Usability Class
2435,the margin is not adjustable which makes a huge waste of the iphone’s screen,Usability Class
2436,"the ui is terrible, ugly, and unbearable",Usability Class
2437,"besides, ibooks supports very few dictionary",Usability Class
2438,"it’s sad because you cannot exect to use it as a tool for learning a second language, say, french or german, while my kindle paperwhite can do everything i want it to do exept it is a little bit slow",Usability Class
2439,"on my iphone when i enlarge my font, the paragraph spaces also get enlarged plus the tittle sizes and it just looks the words have vomited on the page",Usability Class
2440,"and, while you're at it, change the color to sepia, change the font and its size, and adjust the brightness",Usability Class
2441,"the wood-look bookshelves are gone, but that doesn't affect the reading",Usability Class
2442,"if you search the word 'the', it also comes up with 'there' and 'together' and more",Usability Class
2443,it would be better with the old design or any design that resembles a book shelf,Usability Class
2444,"please change the white color and the icon, i never liked this update",Usability Class
2445,i miss the bookshelf background,Usability Class
2446,"i have to have wifi access to download my entire collection every time, and no access to my pdfs",Usability Class
2447,this is the one app that should feel less like a white-washed wall and more like real-life,Usability Class
2448,the blaring white interface makes it virtually impossible to use this app without feeling as though you've been staring directly at the sun,Usability Class
2449,"just like ios 7, functionality and customer satisfaction were not even considered in the design",Usability Class
2450,"i've switched to a different reader, one developed with the customer in mind and one that i can actually use without burning my retinas",Usability Class
2451,could you please tone down the intensity of the highlighting color feature in ibooks,Usability Class
2452,i had an ipad 1st generation and it's ibooks had highlighting colors that were more pastel,Usability Class
2453,much easier on the eyes than the current version,Usability Class
2454,"ps the new gui still looks stupid, too",Usability Class
2455,can apple make their devices more boring and ugly,Usability Class
2456,ios7 is design cancer spreading to all the apps,Usability Class
2457,"for my remaining ibooks purchases, i have switched back to my 2010 old ipad with it's ibooks app as all the reworks of apps to ios7 are so ugly, lower ui",Usability Class
2458,why would i buy a new ios8 ipad with apple's insistence on ugly,Usability Class
2459,the look and feel of having a library and bookshelves has been f****** ripped away,Usability Class
2460,"sure, like lots of the other reviews, i would like to see different themes available so it feels like reading a real book in the app but for me that isn't the biggest problem",Usability Class
2461,"i still have the ios 6 version of this app because i have had a preview of the new look of the ios 7 ibooks and honestly, it looks as if no effort was put into the design of the app whatsoever",Usability Class
2462,i enjoy having the wood texure for my background,Usability Class
2463,design is out of place and doesn't suit reading,Usability Class
2464,i want the view back on the page where i can see how many pages are left in a chapter,Usability Class
2465,i loved the ui with the virtual bookshelf,Usability Class
2466,as for or myself i can say that i will be looking at other options if all i get from you for my money are apps that are ugly and become more and more dysfunctional,Usability Class
2467,the background is nothing like a bookshelf,Usability Class
2468,just a piece of white paper with book titles on it,Usability Class
2469,i miss the look of the book case and why update,Usability Class
2470,the wooden book shelf was the best part of the ibooks app,Usability Class
2471,i really hate the white background,Usability Class
2472,bring it back or at least the option to turn it on if you want,Usability Class
2473,the books are too exensive and the library is small,Usability Class
2474,i could care less about the design,Usability Class
2475,i'm really tired of having to sign in every time i open the app,Usability Class
2476,"also, i'd like to be able to decrease margins",Usability Class
2477,as it is now it seem like there is tex only on roughly half the screen because the margins are so wide,Usability Class
2478,i get tired of having to switch to safari to buy books on other apps,Usability Class
2479,going from my dark desktop to my  night mode book should not involve being forced to look at a glaring white screen that hurts my eyes (even at the lowest brightness),Usability Class
2480,i want the look of a real book with a virtual binder line between the two columns,Usability Class
2481,too mainstream look,Usability Class
2482,"need some changes in look (don't know how to put it in)
hope for some small changes soon",Usability Class
2483,i like that you can change the page color and bookmark pages,Usability Class
2484,"if you really don't like the new style, then remember this: you did't get the app just to look at its background",Usability Class
2485,bad bad bad bad design,Usability Class
2486,whoever designed this design  has to understand that people dont like boring white gradients with floating things on everything,Usability Class
2487,it's like the page isn't calibrated,Usability Class
2488,i liked the wooden bookshelf,Usability Class
2489,what is this white magazine stand,Usability Class
2490,"each book has a different size font - every single time i open a different book, i have to re-adjust the font size",Usability Class
2491,i wouldn't mind if they added a couple of new fonts though,Usability Class
2492,it gets boring with the same font all the time,Usability Class
2493,perhaps apple could provide an update to this app to that the pdf viewed sideways would fit the whole screen like in safari mobile and in adobe reader mobile,Usability Class
2494,terrible design after last update,Usability Class
2495,the new interface seems incomplete and broken,Usability Class
2496,the new look is horrendous,Usability Class
2497,the old design was so much better,Usability Class
2498,seems to take too many steps to keep what you want where you want,Usability Class
2499,"not happy with new look, will never update",Usability Class
2500,new beautiful design  is crap,Usability Class
2501,bye-bye bookshelf,Usability Class
2502,the wooden bookshelf,Usability Class
2503,new design,Usability Class
2504,no design,Usability Class
2505,white nothingness,Usability Class
2506,too white,Usability Class
2507,icon is stupid,Usability Class
2508,hate the white,Usability Class
2509,ugly,Usability Class
2510,"is it asking too much to bring back the old wooden bookshelf and,",Usability Class
2511,"i can easily find the book i'm looking for, download it easily",Usability Class
2512,"also, can you add a variety of colors to the 'underlying' feature",Usability Class
2513,like everyone i don't like the new design the old one was better ,Usability Class
2514,a big reason i wanted to use it over other apps was the quality of design,Usability Class
2515,ios 7 update has huge design opportunity in app,Usability Class
2516,i or  we  as a community want the old look,Usability Class
2517,"and also got rid of the ugly shelves in the ios version,",Usability Class
2518,"sorry but this flattening trend especially as much as they've taken it, it's ugly",Usability Class
2519,couldn't there be some sort of theme ,Usability Class
2520,"so now in addition to an ugly looking app, ",Usability Class
2521,have the old theme if we want,Usability Class
2522,please give us the pastel colors back ,Usability Class
2523,over the last year the requirement to sign in every time i want to read a book is driving me absolutely crazy,Usability Class
2524,"as sometimes it was too small an the white background would hurt my eyes, even with low light",Usability Class
2525,the new design is lame ,Usability Class
2526,it has that nice modern look to match ios 7 ,Usability Class
2527,besides the design complains,Usability Class
2528,i really like the way the app works and looks but,Usability Class
2529,a paper white view would be a wonderful option,Usability Class
2530,"the ui is beautiful,",Usability Class
2531,i actually like the new design and enjoy reading a book in ibooks ,Usability Class
2532,minimalism as to the design is fine ,Usability Class
2533,is blindingly white,Usability Class
2534,the colors are oversaturated ,Usability Class
2535,"the reading interface has improved, ",Usability Class
2536,horrible design,Usability Class
